# JS Craft
My personal e-book which I wrote to understand JavaScript better. Someone once said if you want to understand something deeply then you ought to be able to teach it. I am writing this book to teach my (old self) the kid who thought he knew a lot about programming and JavaScript already.

#### Purpose 
This book will act as a reference guide for me to refresh and reinforce my understanding of JavaScript.
